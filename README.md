# 👋 Hello, I'm David Valente

## 🧭 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student driven by a deep curiosity about technology and how things work. I enjoy exploring a wide range of topics—from software development and systems design to developer tools—and learning by building, experimenting, and asking questions.

Lately, I've been exploring different ways to grow my skills—whether that’s diving into a new language, testing a framework, or understanding the principles behind a new concept.

Outside of programming, I have a strong appreciation for mathematics and physics. I’m fascinated by how these fields help explain and model the world, and I enjoy the challenges and insights they bring to my thinking.

## 🎓 Education

I began my academic journey at **Colégio de Gaia**, where I completed the *Informática e Tecnologias Multimédia* program, gaining a solid foundation in computer science and multimedia technologies.

I’m currently studying at **ISEP** (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto), where I contribute to both academic and independent projects, with a focus on applied software engineering and systems development.

I'm also a member of **[@Nucleo-Estudantes-Informatica-ISEP](https://github.com/Nucleo-Estudantes-Informatica-ISEP)**, where I take part in collaborative and community-based tech initiatives.

## 🚀 Meaningful Projects

One of my highlight projects is my **PAP** (*Prova de Aptidão Profissional*), a mobile fashion app built with **Ionic** and **React**. It uses augmented reality to let customers virtually try on clothing through their cameras, powered by the **Snapchat Lens SDK** for a seamless AR experience.
